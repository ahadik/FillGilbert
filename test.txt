@willsh ... And I think this century is one where Design can help each of us "want" to embrace [resource] constraints as never before
@willsh yes, all sayings are shorthand. A key aspect of Design is about finding beauty in the face of constraints...
While we can debate the term "need," there is an inherent societal "worth" in our deliverables that we should strive for.
But that's not quite right. This century must be where Designers strive to "Make the things people need be the things people want."
Yesterday at @monkigras someone said 20th century was about "making people want things" & 21st century is about "making things people want".
you read my mind, i JUST mapped it! ill be there! RT @lebreeze: @philgilbertsr if you make it over to The City, place is @Curators_Coffee.

BPM is defined by one, and only one, trait: the granular involvement of the business in the control and consumption of their digital assets.
BPM descends from the cultural changes wrought by politics, the Internet and Pong, not from programmers and process weenies.

Nap? Check. Coffee? Check. 9pm start for dinner?  Ugh. BPM is not for the faint of heart!

@richardveryard Ford used standardization of task to drive down costs. I'm suggesting 'standardization' of transparency to drive down risk.
Quote of sxsw from Jon Dee Graham & McMurtry:  it's not Good vs. Evil, it's Everything vs. Nothing!
