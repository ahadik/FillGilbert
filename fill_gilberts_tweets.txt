 that's crazy talk. I live in Texas where the Railroad Commission only deals in oil and  trains are only to be sung about.
Please Lord if I die on the road fly me home in a proper plane. Don't let my last ride be an Embraer CRJ. Something I can stretch out in.
Thank you, American, for calling me at 5:48 to tell me that my 5:45 flight was going to be delayed to 6:12.
Look, if the airlines are going to lose buckets of money anyway, why not kill the hub and spoke system and fly us direct?  #DFWHater

 Politically, can we ever reduce the 'threat level' below Orange, or are we now in a state of forever-fear?
 Spock's mom was Madea?
Kirk: "Who is that pointy-eared bastard?". Star Trek pitch perfect.
Star trek with products group.  Opening scene excellent!
ET  Happy Birthday: Pete Seeger!
Aznavour exceeds expectations with top-notch band/arrangements, performance skills.  A joy to see a craftsman in a world full of lazy hacks.
Aznavour perfect. W/ James Lipton backstage.
 "of" the lucky ones. Sometimes I hate typing on the iphone from a taxi after 4 mint juleps.
 and then bankruptcy. Depression. Suicide. You're one if the lucky ones.
Aznavour. 30 minutes. Legend.

Survived zip lining. And it was way more treachorous than what Mer and Jess did in Panama! 6 or 7 thousand feet in the air. I think.
The birds in St. Lucia Twitter endlessly. I wonder if they're also just telling each other what they had for breakfast.

  Hello Fernando... Lombardi Blueprint twitters... Updates on all types of BPM matters... Cheers!

One trick pony is Bruce's best song in years. Beautiful. "if you've ever seen a 1 trick pony, then you've seen me"
The meat of the set.  Seeds, sadly still appropriate, and then a segue into Johnny 99, with a middle 8 of sympathy for the devil.
Bruce!
